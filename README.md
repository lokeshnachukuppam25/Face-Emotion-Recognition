# Face Emotion Recognition 😄😐😢😠

This project is a **Face Emotion Recognition System** that identifies human emotions based on facial expressions using deep learning techniques. It is developed as part of my learning journey in machine learning and computer vision.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize emotions from images or video input. It can classify the following emotions:
- Angry 😠
- Disgust 🤢
- Fear 😨
- Happy 😄
- Sad 😢
- Surprise 😲
- Neutral 😐

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **tqdm**

## 📦 Installation

Make sure Python and pip are installed. Then follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lokeshnachukuppam25/face-emotion-recognition.git
cd face-emotion-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt


If requirements.txt is not available, manually install the libraries:

pip install tensorflow keras opencv-contrib-python pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tqdm

▶️ How to Run

Run the main script to start detecting emotions:

python emotion_detection.py

Or open the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook Face_Emotion_Recognition.ipynb

📊 Dataset

This project uses the FER-2013 dataset, which consists of 48x48 grayscale images of faces with seven emotion labels. You can download it from Kaggle or integrate it into your workflow.

📚 Learning Purpose

This is a personal learning project to explore:

Deep learning with CNNs

Real-time emotion detection

Working with image datasets

Training and evaluating models
